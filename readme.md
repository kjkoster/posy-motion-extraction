# Motion Extraction as per Posy

This is a quick implementation of video motion extraction, using the method
proposed by [Posy](https://www.youtube.com/@PosyMusic) in his video on
[Motion Extraction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSS6yAMZF78).

[Steve Mould got me interested in motion amplification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEoc0YoALt0),
but I never got round to anything like experimental implementation. The math
behind
[Eulerian Video Magnification](https://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/evm/) was
always a bit daunting. When I ran into Posy's video, making this proof of
concept was quick and easy.

Hope this helps.
